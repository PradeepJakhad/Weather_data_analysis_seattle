# Weather_data_analysis_seattle
## Introduction

Weather patterns significantly influence our daily lives, affecting everything from commuting to planning events. Understanding these patterns is crucial for decision-making in various sectors, including agriculture, transportation, and event planning. This document outlines an analysis of Seattle's weather patterns using Python. We leverage powerful libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to gain insights into precipitation, temperature, wind, and other key weather variables over the years.

## Important Requirements

Google Colab or VS Code Editor: These platforms provide a convenient and accessible environment for coding and data analysis, with features like code completion, debugging, and collaboration.
Latest Version of Python: Ensures compatibility with the latest features and libraries.

## Libraries:

+ pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
+ numpy: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
+ matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
+ seaborn: Built on top of matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
+ plotly: A library for creating interactive, web-based plots and visualizations.

## Importing and Describing the Data

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and reading the Seattle weather dataset, stored in a CSV file. A sample of the dataset is displayed using the sample() function, providing a quick glimpse into the data. The describe() function is then used to obtain statistical summaries of the data, including count, mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for numerical columns, and unique values for categorical columns.

## Exploring the Data

To gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, we examine the information about all columns, including data types and non-null counts, using the info() function. This step helps identify the structure of the data, potential data types issues, and any missing values or inconsistencies that need to be addressed.

## Data Cleaning

In this step, we count the missing values in each column using the isna().sum() function. Rows with missing values are then dropped to create a clean dataset. This process ensures the accuracy of our analysis and visualizations by removing incomplete data that could skew the results.

## Visualizing Precipitation vs. Weather

Using matplotlib, we create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between precipitation and different weather conditions. This visualization helps identify trends and correlations between these variables, providing insights into how precipitation levels vary across different weather types.

## Weather Distribution Pie Charts

We group the data by weather type and count the occurrences of each type. Using matplotlib, we create a pie chart showing the distribution of precipitation across different weather conditions, providing a visual summary of the weather patterns in Seattle. This chart helps identify the most common weather types and their relative prevalence.

## Analyzing Temperature Distribution

A pie chart is also created to analyze the distribution of maximum temperatures across different weather conditions. This visualization helps us understand the temperature patterns in Seattle, highlighting the weather types associated with extreme temperatures.

## Heatmap of Weather Features

A heatmap is generated using seaborn to visualize the correlation between different weather features like date, precipitation, temperature, and wind. This provides insights into how these variables interact with each other, helping identify patterns and relationships that might not be immediately obvious.

## Wind Speed Histogram

Using plotly express, we create an interactive histogram to analyze the distribution of wind speeds in Seattle. This helps in understanding the variability of wind conditions over time, providing a clear picture of how wind speed fluctuates throughout the year.

## Conclusion

In this document, we explored weather trends in Seattle using Python. Through analysis and visualization of precipitation, temperature, and wind, we gained valuable insights into Seattle's weather patterns. This analysis enhances our understanding of weather conditions in Seattle, helping residents and visitors make informed decisions based on weather data.
